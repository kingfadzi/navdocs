# Local storage backend (no S3, files stay on local runner)
deployment:

# Local mode credential defaults for testing
# In local/mock mode, SSH is not used (no remote execution)
# PPM credentials are still required for mock kMigrator scripts

# Servers: Remove SSH configuration (local execution mode)
# Override all servers to remove ssh_host, forcing local execution
