# Python Scripts Refactoring Plan

**Branch:** `feature/simplify-python-scripts`
**Created:** 2025-10-24
**Purpose:** Simplify Python codebase for training and maintainability

---

## Executive Summary

This repository is used for training purposes, requiring code that is:
- Easy to read and understand
- Compact but straightforward
- Simple to follow for learners
- Free of unnecessary complexity

**Current State:** Scripts are functional but overly verbose with excessive print statements, long functions, and repetitive patterns.

**Goal:** Reduce complexity by ~40% while maintaining all functionality.

---

## Core Goals

### 1. **Readability**
- Functions should be under 40 lines
- Clear single responsibility per function
- Eliminate nested complexity

### 2. **Simplicity**
- Reduce verbose print statements by 80%
- Replace multi-line error messages with concise 1-2 line messages
- Remove unnecessary banners and formatting

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Eliminate code duplication
- Standardize import patterns
- Use data-driven approaches where possible

### 4. **Learner-Friendly**
- Code should be self-documenting
- Keep helpful comments (like PPM flag documentation)
- Remove code noise (excessive prints, verbosity)

## Identified Issues

### Issue 1: Excessive Verbosity ❌
**Problem:** Too many print statements creating noise
```python
# BEFORE (5 lines)
print("=" * 60)
print("PHASE 1: EXTRACT")
print("=" * 60)
print(f"Source: {source}, Target: {target}")
print()

# AFTER (1 line)
print(f"\n=== PHASE 1: EXTRACT === Source: {source} → Target: {target}\n")
```

### Issue 2: Functions Too Long ❌
**Problem:** Functions over 100 lines doing multiple things
- `rollback.py:rollback()` - 164 lines
- `archive.py:create_complete_snapshot()` - 120 lines
- `pipeline.py:generate_pipeline()` - 92 lines
- `remote.py:extract()` - 76 lines

### Issue 3: Code Duplication ❌
**Problem:** Repetitive patterns
- Dual import paths in every file (try/except blocks)
- Vault include generation repeated 3 times
- Similar SSH operations duplicated

### Issue 4: Verbose Error Handling ❌
**Problem:** Error messages spanning 15+ lines
```python
# BEFORE (15 lines)
print("=" * 60)
print("ERROR: PPM credentials not set")
print("=" * 60)
print("\nRequired variables:")
print(f"  {username_env}")
print(f"  {password_env}")
print("\nSet them with:")
print(f"  export {username_env}='user'")
# ... etc

# AFTER (3 lines)
print(f"ERROR: Missing credentials: {username_env}, {password_env}")
print(f"Set with: export {username_env}='user' {password_env}='pass'")
print("See README.md for configuration details.")
```

## Refactoring Plan by Script

### Priority 1: Critical Complexity 🔴

#### **1. rollback.py (299 → 180 lines)**
**Issues:**
- 164-line `rollback()` function
- Nested try/except blocks
- Complex fallback logic (GitLab → S3 → Local)

**Refactoring Steps:**
1. ✅ Break `rollback()` into smaller functions:
   - `_try_gitlab_rollback()` - Handle GitLab artifact download
   - `_try_s3_rollback()` - Handle S3 fallback
   - `_load_local_rollback()` - Handle local mode
   - `_execute_rollback()` - Common rollback execution
2. ✅ Reduce print statements by 60%
3. ✅ Use early returns to reduce nesting
4. ✅ Simplify manifest validation

**Expected Reduction:** 119 lines → ~70 lines (41% reduction)

#### **2. orchestrator.py (349 → 250 lines)**
**Issues:**
- Repetitive print banners
- Duplicate try/except imports
- Long command functions

**Refactoring Steps:**
1. ✅ Create `_print_phase()` helper for banners
2. ✅ Reduce banner verbosity
3. ✅ Simplify `validate_command()` credential checking
4. ✅ Remove redundant print statements

**Expected Reduction:** 99 lines (28% reduction)

### Priority 2: High Complexity 🟡

#### **3. archive.py (307 → 200 lines)**
**Issues:**

- Repetitive copy operations
- Verbose prints

**Refactoring Steps:**
1. ✅ Break down `create_complete_snapshot()`:
   - `_setup_snapshot_dir()`
   - `_copy_bundles()`
   - `_copy_artifacts()`
   - `_create_snapshot_manifest()`
   - `_upload_snapshot()`
2. ✅ Reduce print statements

3. ✅ Extract vault reference generation

**Expected Reduction:** 56 lines (29% reduction)

#### **5. utils.py (232 → 150 lines)**
**Issues:**
- `get_ppm_credentials()` error message is 53 lines
- Verbose error handling throughout

**Refactoring Steps:**
1. ✅ Reduce error messages to 2-3 lines max
2. ✅ Simplify print statements
3. ✅ Keep functionality identical

**Expected Reduction:** 82 lines (35% reduction)

#### **6. validation.py (225 → 180 lines)**
**Issues:**
- `check_rules()` has repetitive patterns
- Could be more data-driven

**Refactoring Steps:**
1. ✅ Reduce verbose print output
2. ✅ Simplify rule checking logic
3. ✅ Keep all validation rules intact

**Expected Reduction:** 45 lines (20% reduction)

---
